# Computational-Optimization-Final-Project
These are aspects of Computational Optimization Final Project: the part Projectpart1.tex is the LATEX document I used to generate my report,
the ALM_SVM_quadPenalty.m is the MATLAB code I used for one of my algorithms, the NP_ALM3.m is the MATLAB code I used for the other algorithm, 
the_test_model_SVM_rho02.m is how I tested the ALM_SVM_quadPenalty.m against the testing dataset rho02 for accuracy as well as plots, 
the test_model_SVM_rho08.m is how I tested the ALM_SVM_quadPenalty.m against the testing dataset rho08 for accuracy as well as plots,
the test_NP_ALM.m is the way I tested NP_ALM3.m against the testing algorithm, and finally Projectpart1.pdf is the pdf document I generated
to hand in the project. The finalProject(3).pdf is the description for the assignment for the final project.
